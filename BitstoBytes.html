                    Over two centuries have passed since the invention of the first mechanical calculators in the 19th century. Early 20th-century computer designs were nearly indistinguishable due to their increased size and capability. Ada Lovelace created the first computer program in history in 1848, and Herman Hollerith created a punch-card system for the United States in 1890. Vannevar Bush created the Differential Analyzer, while John Vincent Atanasoff created the first electric-only computer without the need for gears, cams, belts, or shafts. Alan Turing introduced the idea of a universal machine in his work "On Computable Numbers."

                   Computers have become an indispensable tool in modern life, used in homes, hospitals, schools, and offices. Eight developments that have shaped the world we live in today include the ENIAC, IBM's personal computer, Apple's Macintosh, Windows 1.0, the World Wide Web, Sega Saturn and Sony PlayStation, broadband internet, and connected living. ENIAC was developed by John Presper Eckert and John W. Mauchly in 1946 and is considered the first general-purpose electronic computer. IBM's personal computer, the IBM 5150, was launched in 1981 and became popular due to its memory and arithmetic capabilities. The IBM 5150 had 40K of read-only memory and 16K of user memory, a built-in speaker, self-diagnostic checks, and Microsoft's MS-DOS 1.0 operating system.

                In 1984, Steve Jobs launched the first Macintosh, targeting 25 million knowledge workers in medium and small-sized businesses and over 11 million college students in America alone. Windows 1.0 was launched in 1985 as an operating system with a graphical interface, and the latest versions are used by millions worldwide. The World Wide Web was introduced in 1989 by British computer scientist Tim Berners-Lee at CERN, where the world's first website and server went live a year later. The Sega Saturn and Sony PlayStation consoles, launched in 1994, blazed a trail in the video gaming industry, with games on CDs rather than cartridges.

                The mass adoption of broadband internet across the developed world has led to high-speed downloads, super-fast browsing, and high-resolution streaming. In the U.K., there were 25.3 million fixed broadband connections at the end of 2016. Connected living in the 2000s saw homes rapidly transform into spaces where traditional computers dovetail alongside newer technology, such as smartphones, smart TVs, virtual assistants, and tablets. With the click of a button, a song being played on a computer in someone's bedroom can be displayed on a 72-inch TV in their living room via a high-speed, wireless connection. This merging of physical and virtual worlds is known as the internet of things.

            Alan Turing, a significant mathematician during World War II, played a crucial role in breaking the German Enigma code at Blatchley Park. He designed a computer called the Bombe to decipher the German messages, reducing the war's duration and saving millions of lives. Turing's team had to avoid discovering that Enigma had been decrypted, using an electromechanical device to calculate the key of the day the Germans were using on their Enigma machine. The Bombe operators could set up the machine and calculate possible Enigma settings using a menu provided by the codebreaking team. After the war, Turing developed the Turing Test, a method to test artificial intelligence. Persecuted for homosexual acts, he committed suicide in 1954.

              Philip Donald Estridge, known as Don Estridge, led development of the original IBM Personal Computer, and thus is known as “father of the IBM PC”. Don Estridge gave Skellings' corporation an IBM contract to develop the Electric Literature series which featured the “Electric Poet” software. The initial IBM Personal Computer (PC), which is the current generation of computers, was developed under Philip Don Estridge's direction.  The company's primary goal was to get into the market for tiny computers. By using OEM off-the-shelf parts rather than developing new technology, IBM was able to keep costs down and produce PCs in less than a year. Furthermore, the software's open architecture enables the usage of peripherals made by different vendors. This implied that other businesses may begin producing computers that were compatible with IBM. When Apple decided to utilize Intel processors in their Macs instead of proprietary ones, it also employed this design.

                Our world is still being shaped by computing, which has an impact on how things are made, how information is accessed, and how people communicate with one another. It has also changed the way we think about the outside world and the cosmos. The advancement of computer technology is an enabling process rather than merely a series of innovations. One of the biggest advances in computing history is the web, which has paved the way for the development of quick, low-cost computers, reasonably priced disk storage, and networking technologies. As a result, an open-source development culture began to take shape, where communities contributed to and shared common operating systems, programming languages, and tools.

                With the expansion of networks, software ownership, design, and control over environments might be drastically altered as tools created in one location could be quickly shared, promoted, and implemented elsewhere. As a result, the world wide web—a digital traffic infrastructure—was established. A rise in processing power made it possible to provide services remotely.

                With so many people using the internet, standalone computers have becoming less important. Search engines wouldn't work efficiently without behaviors to learn from, and human activities have integrated into the system. The problems of the field have altered substantially as a result of big data, which is fed by human data streams including traffic data, airline journeys, financial transactions, and social media. The data products also have an instantaneous influence on people. Nowadays, data-driven learning replaces the manual coding of algorithms to make decisions, potentially rendering entire disciplines of study useless.

                Individually utilized items are referred to as hardware, while programs that operate on hardware are referred to as software. For example, Microsoft Word is a piece of software that runs on a Windows computer that has a motherboard, hard drive, and central processor unit. An knowledge of IT necessitates a grasp of a number of physical components, such as the random access memory (RAM), which is used for temporary storage, the hard drive, which saves data, and the CPU, which receives electrical signals to transfer instructions. Information may be accessed and modified more quickly using RAM, whereas binary-encoded data is stored on the hard drive. The motherboard is a large circuit board that supports communication, provides power to the CPU and hard drive, and houses them. Comprehending these constituents is crucial for the efficient operation of a technology-driven infrastructure.

                IT software, in conjunction with physical components, is critical to efficiency and productivity. The operating system of a computer is called system software, which is kept on the hard drive and transferred to RAM as needed. By providing instructions to the CPU, it enables the operating system to run applications, or application software. Word processors, spreadsheets, and web browsers are examples of application software that runs in RAM and uses electrical pulses to save data on the hard drive. Anti-virus and optimization programs are examples of utility software that runs on the hard disk and is typically invisible to the user.

                IT is essential for both market competitiveness and company continuity. IT governance include controlling risks, developing strategy-supporting policies, and coordinating corporate objectives with IT. IT Operations Management saves time, money, and human resources by automating critical procedures that enable remote assistance and early problem identification. Data and networks must be protected by cybersecurity measures, especially as the number of attack surfaces posed by cloud-based apps and data storage grows. 
                When it comes to patching, upgrading, automated monitoring, alerting, access restrictions, and strong credentials, IT personnel need to be extremely watchful. To safeguard sensitive data, database administration, frequent patching, and access control guidelines are essential. It is preferable to identify issues early on rather than later. Organizations must have data backups in place to guard against natural catastrophes and ransomware. IT service providers should provide functional material and frequent customer backups. The kind of backup relies on the requirements of the company; some use local, hybrid, cloud-based, or file storage solutions. IT specialists should go over the benefits and drawbacks of each and make sure backups happen on time. Network management is necessary to increase security and make sure that devices adhere to rules. 
                Because virtualization reduces the number of servers required, it can save money and boost the efficiency of the IT staff. An essential part of the IT team's work is software troubleshooting, when technicians carry out intricate operations or automated inspections. Software must be free of bugs in order to maintain security and commercial operations.
